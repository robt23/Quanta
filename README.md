# Quanta

Quanta is an on-going in-house quantitative trading model, aimed at helping us develop skills and strategies in quantitative finance as we build the model from scratch. We will start from basic research, system design, algorithm implementation, backtesting, paper trading, and if we obtain enough capital: executing real trades on the NYSE. Our main goal is to learn, and hopefully with the side effect of creating a consistently and continuously profitable model. Follow for more.

This project was started in July 2025 by Robert Tian (UC Berkeley EECS + DS '27), Darren Zeng (UC Berkeley EECS '27), and Daniel Zhou (UCLA CSE '27). Our research notes and various strategy implementations can be found in this repo.
